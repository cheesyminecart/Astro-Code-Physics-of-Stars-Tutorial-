# Astro-Data-Archive
Just a place to keep all my .fits or .csv files for astronomy! Projects are individual and will have links back to these files, promise!

This data has been collected and manually downloaded from the GAIA or JWST archives. Thanks to the "lightkurve" model this may not be needed anymore - though I doubt it, it's quite fun manually finding and processing data.
